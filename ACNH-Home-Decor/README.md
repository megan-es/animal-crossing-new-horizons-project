<img src="/ACNH-Home-Decor/images/my_villager_and_house.jpg" alt="My Animal Crossing Character" width="275"/>

## Overview
This project analyzes the real estate values within the game [Animal Crossing: New Horizons](https://animalcrossing.nintendo.com/new-horizons/) It focuses on the buy and sell values of home decor for the villagers, comparing these values across various attributes such as species, personality, and gender.

## Built With
This project is built using the following [Python](https://www.python.org) libraries:

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Data analysis and manipulation tool.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - Statistical data visualization based on Matplotlib.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project comes from [Kaggle's Animal Crossing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nookplaza-dataset). This dataset includes information pertaining to villagers, items, and achievements found within Animal Crossing New Horizons.

## Key Findings
- Villagers exhibit a wide range of home decor values, with some species and personalities showing a higher average net value than others.
- Gender comparison revealed distinct differences in the average buy and sell values of home decor.
- The `Sugarshine` subset analysis provided insights into the real estate market of my own island, Sugarshine.

## Analysis and Visualizations
The analysis involves:
- Calculating the net value of each villager's home decor.
- Visualizing the average buy and sell values grouped by species, personality, and gender.
- Creating a specific analysis for the `Sugarshine` island, showcasing individual and average values.

## Repository Contents
- `ACNH_Homes.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code.
- `villagers.csv`: Dataset file containing the information about the villagers.
- `sugarshine_villager_names.csv`: Custom dataset with villagers from my own personal island, Sugarshine`.
- `visualizations/`: Directory containing generated visualizations.
- `enhanced-datasets/`: Directory containing enhanced datafiles including total buy and sell prices of villagers homes, both for the entirety of the Villagers dataset, as well as a filtered dataset to include only villagers that exist on my island, 

## Usage
To run the analysis, ensure you have a Python environment with the necessary libraries installed, including pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
