## Repository Overview
This repository hosts two distinct yet interrelated projects focusing on the analysis of villagers in the game [Animal Crossing: New Horizons](https://animalcrossing.nintendo.com/new-horizons/) using data from [Kaggle Animal Crossing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nookplaza-dataset). This dataset includes information pertaining to villagers, items, and achievements found within Animal Crossing New Horizons. Each project is maintained in separate branches:

1. **General Demographics and Music Preferences Analysis**: Found in the branch `general_demographics_and_music`.
2. **Real Estate Analysis**: Located in the branch `ACNH_home_decor`.
3. **Animal Crossing New Horizons Nookplaza Dataset** Found in `animal-crossing-new-horizons-nookplaza-dataset`, downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nookplaza-dataset).

## Projects Description
### General Demographics and Music Preferences Analysis
This branch focuses on exploring the general demographics (species, gender, personality) of the Animal Crossing villagers and analyzing their music preferences. For detailed information, visit the [general-demographics-and-music](https://github.com/megan-es/animal-crossing-new-horizons-project/tree/main/general-demographics-and-music).

### Home Decor Analysis
The home decor analysis branch delves into the home values within Animal Crossing, examining the buy and sell values of villagers' home decor. It includes a specific subset analysis of the villagers on my own personal island, Sugarshine. For more details, check out [ACNH-Home-Decor](https://github.com/megan-es/animal-crossing-new-horizons-project/tree/main/ACNH-Home-Decor).
