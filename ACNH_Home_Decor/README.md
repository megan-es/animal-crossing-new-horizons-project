# Animal Crossing New Horizons Villager Real Estate Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the real estate values within the game Animal Crossing: New Horizons. It focuses on the buy and sell values of home decor for the villagers, comparing these values across various attributes such as species, personality, and gender.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project comes from [Kaggle's Animal Crossing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nookplaza-dataset). It includes details about the villagers, their home decor preferences, and the corresponding buy and sell values.

## Key Findings
- Villagers exhibit a wide range of home decor values, with some species and personalities showing a higher average net value than others.
- Gender comparison revealed distinct differences in the average buy and sell values of home decor.
- The `Sugarshine` subset analysis provided insights into the real estate market of a particular in-game island.

## Analysis and Visualizations
The analysis involves:
- Calculating the net value of each villager's home decor.
- Visualizing the average buy and sell values grouped by species, personality, and gender.
- Creating a specific analysis for the `Sugarshine` island, showcasing individual and average values.
