# Animal Crossing New Horizons Villagers Demographics and Music Preferences Analysis

## Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the demographics and music preferences of the villagers in the game, [Animal Crossing: New Horizons](https://animalcrossing.nintendo.com/new-horizons/). The analysis aims to uncover trends and patterns in the villagers' characteristics and their favorite songs.

## Dataset
The analysis utilizes a comprehensive dataset of villagers in Animal Crossing from [Kaggle's Animal Crossing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nookplaza-dataset) which includes information on species, gender, personality, hobbies, and their favorite songs.

## Objectives
- To understand the distribution of various demographic attributes such as species, gender, and personality among the villagers.
- To analyze music preferences and find the most popular songs among different groups of villagers.
- To investigate any correlations between villagers' demographics and their music tastes.

## Methodology
The analysis involves:
- Descriptive statistics to understand the demographic distribution.
- Visualization of music preferences using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Correlation analysis between demographic attributes and music choices.

## Libraries Used
